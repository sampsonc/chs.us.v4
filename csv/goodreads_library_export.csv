As a python tutorial, it is really well-organized and comprehensive.  As the book goes along, more advanced Python features are discussed and applied to the particular topic of cryptography that goes along with it.  It is a very captivating and effective way to not only learn python, but also learn some about cryptography.  <br/><br/>The strongest part of the book is how the python language is taught with clear and concise examples, each building upon the previous.  The introduction to cryptography is really effective at keeping the reader engaged and learning by applying the python lessens to various cryptographic topics.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book.",,,1,0
