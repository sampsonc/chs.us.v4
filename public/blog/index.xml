The Python community never ceases to innovate. One of the most recent additions to Python&amp;rsquo;s vast feature set is &amp;ldquo;subinterpreters&amp;rdquo;. As the name suggests, subinterpreters provide a way to run multiple isolated Python interpreters within a single process. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive deeper into this novel concept and discuss its advantages and potential use cases.
What are Subinterpreters?
At a high level, each subinterpreter in Python has its own distinct memory space and execution state.</description></item><item><title>Turtle Cove Snorkeling</title><link>/blog/turtle-cove-snorkeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 09:16:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/turtle-cove-snorkeling/</guid><description/></item><item><title>HTML5 PostMessage Security: Protecting Cross-Origin Communication</title><link>/html5-postmessage-security/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/html5-postmessage-security/</guid><description>HTML5 introduced a powerful feature called postMessage that allows secure communication between different origins or domains. While this functionality provides a convenient way to exchange data across frames or windows, it also poses potential security risks if not implemented correctly. In this article, we will explore the security considerations of using postMessage and discuss best practices to protect cross-origin communication.
Understanding postMessage postMessage is an HTML5 feature that enables asynchronous communication between different browsing contexts.</description></item><item><title>What is GitHub CoPilot?</title><link>/blog/what-is-github-copilot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/what-is-github-copilot/</guid><description>GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It uses machine learning algorithms to assist developers in writing code by suggesting code snippets based on the context of the code being written. This powerful tool has the ability to autocomplete code, provide inline documentation, and generate entire functions, making coding easier and more efficient.
GitHub Copilot is built on top of OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-3 language model, which has been trained on a vast amount of data from a variety of sources, including code repositories, documentation, and programming languages.</description></item><item><title>Writing a Basic Burp Extension in Python</title><link>/blog/burp-extension-in-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 09:16:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/burp-extension-in-python/</guid><description>Burp Suite is a popular web security testing tool that helps you secure web applications by testing and validating vulnerabilities. It’s a comprehensive platform for performing security assessments on web applications, and its extensibility is one of its key features.
Burp Suite extensions are add-ons that allow you to customize and extend the functionality of Burp Suite. These extensions can be written in any JVM-compatible language, including Java, Python, and Ruby.</description></item><item><title>Context Managers in Python</title><link>/blog/python-context-managers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 09:16:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/python-context-managers/</guid><description>Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that offers many features to help developers write clean and efficient code. One of these features is the use of context managers. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at what context managers are and how they can be used to simplify and improve your Python code.
A context manager is an object that defines the methods enter() and exit().</description></item><item><title>Content Security Policy (CSP)</title><link>/blog/csp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 09:16:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/csp/</guid><description>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security measure that helps protect web applications from various attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection. CSP works by specifying a set of Content Security Rules that dictate what resources are allowed to load on a page. This can be used to whitelist trusted sources of content, or to block untrusted content entirely.
One advantage of Content Security Policy is that it can help to prevent malicious code from running on a page.</description></item><item><title>Writing a Burp Extension in Ruby Part 1</title><link>/blog/burp_plugin_ruby_part_1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 14:05:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>/blog/burp_plugin_ruby_part_1/</guid><description>Writing a Burp Extension in Ruby Burp extensions can be written in 3 languages - Java, Python, and Ruby. Since Burp is a java app, in order to write extensions in Python you need Jython and in Ruby you need JRuby. For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll use Ruby.
Step 1 - Downloading JRuby The first step is to download JRuby from https://jruby.org/download.

Passive Search searches for a list of terms in HTTP responses and creates an issue if it finds one.
I got the idea of after maintaining a list of things that I was checking for in responses and using either the search in HTTP History on an item by item basis or using the global Search. It was a completely manual process.</description></item><item><title>New Project!</title><link>/blog/new-project/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 06:25:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/new-project/</guid><description>Today I started a new project that I’ve been thinking about for awhile.

The basic idea is that they create lists from other iterables. They consists of brackets containing the expression which is executed against each item in the iterable object. One or more conditionals dictate if the item is added to the new list.
The basic format is –
list = [expression for_loop_one_or_more conditions]</description></item><item><title>AuthHeader Updater listed on snoopysecurity/awesome-burp-extensions</title><link>/blog/authheader-updater-listed-on-snoopysecurity-awesome-burp-extensions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 01:40:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/authheader-updater-listed-on-snoopysecurity-awesome-burp-extensions/</guid><description>Excited to see AuthHeader Updater on a list of awesome burp extensions!</description></item><item><title>Auth Header Updater Released!</title><link>/blog/auth-header-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 03:43:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/auth-header-update/</guid><description>Excited to release Auth Header Updater today – a Burp extension to update Authorization headers during a scan and also guest post about it on ihackthings.online.

It adds a new tab to Burp and samples every 5 seconds-
Current and max number of threads in use
Current and max memory used

It handles x86 and x84 executables. If doing it manually, you must check several values in the PE (Portable Executable) file header that differ slightly based on whether the executable is 32-bit or 64-bit. BinPeek does that work for you.

These are key to think about during the design phase of a feature/project?
Total Mediation – every access to every resource must be validated every time
Economy of Mechanism – keep it as simple as possible
Fail-Safe – in case of failure, default to a secure state
Defense in Depth – layer security
Open Design – the security of a system should not be dependent on secrecy of its design or implementation</description></item><item><title>2 Gems Updated</title><link>/blog/gemsupdated/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 02:57:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/gemsupdated/</guid><description>PwnedCheck
