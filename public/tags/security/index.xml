While this functionality provides a convenient way to exchange data across frames or windows, it also poses potential security risks if not implemented correctly. In this article, we will explore the security considerations of using postMessage and discuss best practices to protect cross-origin communication.
Understanding postMessage postMessage is an HTML5 feature that enables asynchronous communication between different browsing contexts.</description></item><item><title>Content Security Policy (CSP)</title><link>/blog/csp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 09:16:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/csp/</guid><description>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security measure that helps protect web applications from various attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection. CSP works by specifying a set of Content Security Rules that dictate what resources are allowed to load on a page. This can be used to whitelist trusted sources of content, or to block untrusted content entirely.
One advantage of Content Security Policy is that it can help to prevent malicious code from running on a page.</description></item><item><title>New Project!</title><link>/blog/new-project/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 06:25:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/new-project/</guid><description>Today I started a new project that I’ve been thinking about for awhile. It’s located at – https://appsec.fyi. It is a growing collection of interesting links that I’ve found regarding varying application security topics. The basic site is up and the plumbing is there. Just need to add more content.

I was really interested in the the resource usage of Burp while doing certain activities.
It adds a new tab to Burp and samples every 5 seconds-
Current and max number of threads in use
Current and max memory used
Current and max memory allocated
Ticker to set how often the stats update.</description></item><item><title>Secure Design Principles</title><link>/blog/secure-design-principles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2017 02:50:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/secure-design-principles/</guid><description>Sitting here on a cold, snowy day thinking about secure design principles. These are key to think about during the design phase of a feature/project?
Total Mediation – every access to every resource must be validated every time
Economy of Mechanism – keep it as simple as possible
Fail-Safe – in case of failure, default to a secure state
Defense in Depth – layer security
Open Design – the security of a system should not be dependent on secrecy of its design or implementation</description></item><item><title>2 Gems Updated</title><link>/blog/gemsupdated/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 02:57:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/gemsupdated/</guid><description>PwnedCheck
