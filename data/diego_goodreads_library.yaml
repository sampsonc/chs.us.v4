  myreview: Great book about the history of Van Halen from the beginning until after their first record came out.   Lots of stories from people that know them and were a part of the back yard party scene in the early days and their club days later.

  myreview: This is the 2nd book I've read from Al Sweigart and I'm yet to be disappointed.  As a python tutorial, it is really well-organized and comprehensive.  As the book goes along, more advanced Python features are discussed and applied to the particular topic of cryptography that goes along with it.  It is a very captivating and effective way to not only learn python, but also learn some about cryptography.  <br/><br/>The strongest part of the book is how the python language is taught with clear and concise examples, each building upon the previous.  The introduction to cryptography is really effective at keeping the reader engaged and learning by applying the python lessens to various cryptographic topics.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book.
